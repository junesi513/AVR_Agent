[2025-06-27 02:14:08] [javac-output-4173349] warning: [options] location of system modules is not set in conjunction with -source 11
[2025-06-27 02:14:08] [javac-output-4173349]   not setting the location of system modules may lead to class files that cannot run on JDK 11
[2025-06-27 02:14:08] [javac-output-4173349]     --release 11 is recommended instead of -source 11 -target 11 because it sets the location of system modules automatically
