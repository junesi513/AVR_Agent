[2025-06-27 11:10:39] [javac-output-255373] warning: [options] location of system modules is not set in conjunction with -source 11
[2025-06-27 11:10:39] [javac-output-255373]   not setting the location of system modules may lead to class files that cannot run on JDK 11
[2025-06-27 11:10:39] [javac-output-255373]     --release 11 is recommended instead of -source 11 -target 11 because it sets the location of system modules automatically
