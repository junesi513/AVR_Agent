[2025-06-27 03:11:01] [javac-output-32760] warning: [options] location of system modules is not set in conjunction with -source 11
[2025-06-27 03:11:01] [javac-output-32760]   not setting the location of system modules may lead to class files that cannot run on JDK 11
[2025-06-27 03:11:01] [javac-output-32760]     --release 11 is recommended instead of -source 11 -target 11 because it sets the location of system modules automatically
